# Bible_in_Markdown
Bash script which converts The Holy Bible from an xml format to Markdown suitable for Obsidian

Download a Bible of your choice from [https://www.ph4.org/b4_mobi.php?q=zefania](https://www.ph4.org/b4_mobi.php?q=zefania)

Place that zip file in the same folder as this bash script.

Run the bash script.  In about 3 to 4 minutes you will have a master folder with 66 sub-folders (one for each Book of the Bible) and in each folder will be a file for each of the chapters in that particualr book.
